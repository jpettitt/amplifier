# Amplifier
Amplifier AMP/Canonical switcher Chrome Extension

This extension is designed for developers working with the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) standard.  It detects AMP links
in the page header and allows quick switching between the AMP and Canonical version of a page.  Optionally AMP pages can be loaded
with the AMP validation enabled (#development=1).
